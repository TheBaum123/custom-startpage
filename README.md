# Custom Startpage
This is the place where I host my custom startpage for my browser so that its easyer to use on multiple browsers and devices. I don't really advise anyone to use this, since i didn't care abput customisability/configurability or anything else, but if you want to, you can still fork the repo and just edit the html to include your bookmarks or just use it if you want the same bookmarks as me.

# Search "shortcuts"
Using the search bar, you are able to search google, but also do some other things which are:

Opening the folowing sites by typing in theyre name:
- reddit
- youtube
- twitch
- github
- netflix

---
You can type {Sitename}:{Searchquery} to search on the folowing sites:
- reddit
- youtube
- twitch
- github
- netflix

> **there are no spaces needed in between {site:}{your search query}** which means you can for example search `github:TheBaum123` to search github for "TheBaum123"

# config
For the colors in the configurations you should be able to use all hex colors aswell as predefined css colors such as red, green, blue, pink, etc.
## GUI
Clicking the settings item in the bottom right will take you to a configuration gui, which should be pretty much self explanatory, but not my priority in development so it isn't anywhere close to good looking or working flawlessly. You can alternatively acess the configuration gui by typing `:gui` into the searchbar and pressing enter.

## commands
You can also chage some of the settings directly with built in commands:
- `config default` - resets all of the config to default and clears locally saved data
- `config bg-color {color}` - changes the background color to whatever you type instead of `{color}`
- `config highlight-color {color}` - same thing, but for the color that is used for highlighting icons on hover
- `config focused-color {color}` - same thing, but for the color of the searchbar while typing
- `config text-color {color}` -same thing, but for the text color
