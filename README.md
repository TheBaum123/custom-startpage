# Custom Startpage
This is the place where I host my custom startpage for my browser so that its easyer to use on multiple browsers and devices. I don't really advise anyone to use this, since i didn't care abput customisability/configurability or anything else, but if you want to, you can still fork the repo and just edit the html to include your bookmarks or just use it if you want the same bookmarks as me.
